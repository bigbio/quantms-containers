Herein the terms 'DIA-NN' or 'DIA-NN software' are used to refer to specifically the
version of the DIA-NN software which packs this license file in its distribution package.

1. Special DIA-NN software usage scenarios.
Collaborative use refers to any usage of the DIA-NN software solely for the purpose of
carrying out a joint collaborative project between yourself or your institution and the Demichev
laboratory at the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The nature of the project and the intended
use of the DIA-NN software in this case must be agreed with the Demichev laboratory in advance.

2. The DIA-NN software is licensed to you for use only under the terms of this License,
and all rights not expressly granted to you are reserved. The rights granted herein are limited to Vadim Demichev’s intellectual
property rights in the DIA-NN software and do not include any other patents or intellectual property rights.

3. Permitted use. Provided the usage restrictions imposed by this License are satisfied,
this License allows you to install and use the DIA-NN software solely for the purpose of
academic research or education. Commercial or for-profit use of DIA-NN is not permitted.
You may make one copy of the DIA-NN software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only,
provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.
Usage of DIA-NN in the cloud is only permitted under Collaborative use. Except as and only to the extent expressly
permitted in this License or by applicable law, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble,
attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the DIA-NN software or any part thereof.

4. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend or sublicense the DIA-NN software. You may, however, make a one-time permanent transfer
of all of your license rights to the DIA-NN software to another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include all of the DIA-NN software,
including all its component parts, original media, printed materials and this License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the DIA-NN software,
full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the DIA-NN software reads
and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of this License.

5. Attribution. If you share, distribute or publish any materials that were produced using the DIA-NN software ("Derived Materials"), you must indicate
within these Derived Materials that they were produced using the DIA-NN software. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which you share the Derived Materials. For example, the required attribution can be expressed by including
one of the statements "Processed using DIA-NN", "Generated using DIA-NN" or "Produced using DIA-NN" in the Derived Materials.

6. All third-party software included in this DIA-NN software distribution retains its original license.
For the inclusion in this DIA-NN software distribution, the source code of MSToolkit and MiniDNN was modified.
If not packaged within this distribution, please find the source code of the third-party software at https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN
or at the respective website of the third-party software.

7. Experimental functionality.
Any of the DIA-NN commands/options that are not referenced at https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN/blob/master/README.md
are considered Experimental functionality. The following DIA-NN commands/options are also considered Experimental functionality:
--extract
--mgf
Experimental functionality is in the process of being actively developed and is thus shared 'on collaborative basis'
before it is published in a peer-reviewed publication. It is not tested as thoroughly as the rest of DIA-NN and
needs to be used with caution, with expertise in the internal workings of DIA-NN potentially required for correct use.
Any peer-reviewed publication or academic preprint derived from any usage of Experimental functionality that occurs
before a peer-reviewed manuscript describing the respective Experimental functionality is published must therefore
be published in collaboration and co-authorship with the Demichev laboratory. Using Experimental functionality is not
permitted if you do not agree to the above. A peer-reviewed manuscript is considered to describe a particular
Experimental functionality if (i) it is referenced at https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN/blob/master/README.md
as describing this functionality and (ii) the date when it was made available online by the publisher falls after
the date on which the specific version of the DIA-NN software to which this license refers to was built.
